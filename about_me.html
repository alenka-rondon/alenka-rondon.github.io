    <div class="borders">
        <h1>School </h1>
        <p> I am a first year UWaterloo student!  I am currently in my 1B term, and since I am in sequence 4, I will be on 
            campus for a study term during Spring 2022 as well!  I am a First Year Representative for MathSoc, an organization 
            that represents the interests of Math students at UWaterloo.  I am also on the Board of Directors.
            <br>
            <br>

            Some of my favourite school experiences so far include attending MathSoc events as well as other events such as WiCS!
            Feel free to check their sites out, and if you're a student at Waterloo try to drop by some of their events!

        <h1>Personal Interests </h1>
        <p> I love spending my time doing all sorts of puzzles such as jigsaws, sudoku, crosswords, etc!

            As linked on my main site, I find the New York Times to be a particularly great source of Sudoku, 
            and they also provide a daily mini-crossword (and regular-sized crossword, but that requires a subscription).

            I am also a firm believer in keeping an organized schedule, and it has helped me a lot in achieving my daily goals.

            Feel free to take a look at a few different digital templates I've made for Notability:
            <ul>
               <li> <a href = "documents/Calendar.pdf"> Calendar pdf file</a> </li>
               <li> <a href = "documents/Calendar.note"> Calendar note file </a> </li>
               <li> <a href = "documents/Daily.note"> Daily note file</a> </li>

            </ul>
        </p>
