    <div class="borders">
        <h1>School </h1>
        <p> I am a first year UWaterloo student!  I am currently in my 1B term, and since I am in sequence 4, I will be on 
            campus for a study term during Spring 2022 as well!  I am a First Year Representative for MathSoc, an organization 
            that represents the interests of Math students at UWaterloo.  I am also on the Board of Directors, where we help
            make important decisions regarding logistics around elections, exec reviews, etc.  
        </p>

    <div class="borders">
        <h1>Personal Interests </h1>
        <p> I love spending my time doing all sorts of puzzles such as jigsaws, sudoku, crosswords, etc!

            I am also a firm believer in keeping an organized schedule, and it has helped me a lot in achieving my daily goals.

            Feel free to take a look at a digital template for Notability I've made
