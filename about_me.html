    <div class="borders">
        <h1>School </h1>
        <p> I am a first year UWaterloo student!  I am currently in my 1B term, and since I am in sequence 4, I will be on 
            campus for a study term during Spring 2022 as well!  I am a First Year Representative for MathSoc, an organization 
            that represents the interests of Math students at UWaterloo.  I am also on the Board of Directors, where we help
            make important decisions regarding logistics around elections, exec reviews, etc.
