            <h2>TaskListr</h2>
            <p> Developed a website that would keep track of and save a user's tasks.  They could use it as a daily checklist for 
                tasks that they need to use.  Later modified it to allow user customization of the visual aspects of the tasklist.

            <h2>Personal Website</h2>
            <p> Developed this website in order to learn HTML and CSS.  Later hope to redevelop using the tools I've learned from building
                my TaskListr project with React and Javascript.

            <h2>Casino Games</h2>
            <p> Worked with a team to develop a program in java using OOP in order to create a Casino-like program, which would
                keep track of a user's money and casino chips, and implemented a variety of games such as Blackjack, 
                Roulette, and 21.
