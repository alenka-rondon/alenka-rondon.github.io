            <p>
            I am a Waterloo CS student in my 1B term!  Some of my favourite courses so far have been: 
            
            
            <ul>
                <li> MATH 135: Algebra for Honours Mathematics</li>
                <li> CS 135: Designing Functional Programs</li>
                <li> ENGL 108B: Global English Literatures</li>
            </ul>

            </p>

            Currently, I live in Waterloo and am on a study term, but I am from Markham, ON.

            <h1>TaskListr</h1>
            <p> Developed a website that would keep track of and save a user's tasks.  They could use it as a daily checklist for 
                tasks that they need to use.  Later modified it to allow user customization of the visual aspects of the tasklist.

            <h1>Casino Games</h1>
            <p> Worked with a team to develop a program in java using OOP in order to create a Casino-like program, which would
                keep track of a user's money and casino chips, and implemented a variety of games such as Blackjack, 
                Roulette, and 21.
